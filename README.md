# Red Light, Green Light

### Author: 
Chunan (Oscar) Huang

### Design: 
Mimic a popular children game "red light, green light", which is used in a popular TV show "Squid Game".
Basically you need to reach the "goal", but you can only move when is couting down (sound playing).
You die if you are still moving when the sound stops.
One difference I made here is that I added momentum (so you may need to stop earlier or use other tricks).

### How To Play:
WASD to move. Mouse to rotate view. Escape to reactivate mouse cursor.
